+ ~~Basic assertions~~
+ ~~Test Runner for junit style tests~~
+ ~~Spec Runner for spec style tests~~
+ ~~Command line runner to scan test directories for test classes~~
+ ~~OpenFL support out of the box with no special config~~

Backlog
-------
+ Add an -openfl flag to prevent default inclusion of OpenFL libraries in build process
+ Look into @Test metadata instead of using test_ for test runner tests.

Research
--------
+ Review munit's build system and look for ways to improve hxpect, see http://lib.haxe.org/p/munit and https://github.com/massiveinteractive/MassiveUnit
+ Review buddy and see if hxpect is even needed

Wishlist
--------
+ Consider use of metadata to identify tests and test classes
